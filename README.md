# ComparisonSortingAlgorithms
 
In this article, we analyze the speed and compare four sorting algorithms: 
 - insertion sort
 - heap sort
 - merge sort
 - quick sort
 
The way we will compare sorting methods is to track the time it takes for each sorting method to sort vectors whose size is from 100 to 10,000 numbers (from 0 to 10,000) randomly filled.
